Here's how to create a structured dataset representing frontend, backend, and full-stack technology stacks. I'll provide a core structure and examples, adaptable to your preferred database or spreadsheet format.

**Dataset Structure**

**Table 1: Stacks**

* **stack_id** (Primary Key) 
* **stack_name** (e.g., MERN, MEAN, LAMP)
* **description** (A brief overview of the stack)
* **type** (Frontend, Backend, Full-Stack)

**Table 2: Technologies**

* **tech_id** (Primary Key)
* **tech_name** (e.g., React, Node.js, MySQL)
* **category** (e.g., Framework, Language, Database)

**Table 3: Stack_Technologies** (Linking Table)

* **stack_id** (Foreign Key referencing Stacks table)
* **tech_id**  (Foreign Key referencing Technologies table)

**Example Data**

**Table 1: Stacks**

| stack_id | stack_name | description                                             | type         |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1        | MERN       | MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js                     | Full-Stack   |
| 2        | MEAN       | MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js                   | Full-Stack   |
| 3        | LAMP       | Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP                               | Full-Stack   |
| 4        | React      | Frontend library for building user interfaces            | Frontend     |
| 5        | Node.js    | JavaScript runtime environment for the server-side      | Backend      |

**Table 2: Technologies**

| tech_id | tech_name  | category     |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1       | React      | Framework    |
| 2       | Node.js    | Runtime      |
| 3       | Express.js | Framework    |
| 4       | MongoDB    | Database     |
| 5       | Angular    | Framework    |

**Table 3: Stack_Technologies**

| stack_id | tech_id |
| -------- | -------- |
| 1        | 1       |
| 1        | 2       |
| 1        | 3       |
| 1        | 4       |
| 2        | 2       |
| 2        | 3       | 
| 2        | 4       | 
| 2        | 5       | 

**How to Use This Dataset**

* **Question Tagging:** Tie interview questions to stack_ids and tech_ids 
* **Filtering:**  A  user selects "MERN"  and "Backend," so you  query for questions matching those criteria.

**Notes:**

* **Expansion:** Add more stacks, technologies, and detailed columns as needed (e.g., version numbers).
* **Tool Choice:** Implement this in a database (SQLite, MySQL, etc.) for larger datasets, or start with spreadsheets.
